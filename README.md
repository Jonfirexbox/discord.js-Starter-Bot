# discord.js-Starter-Bot
This is a free-to-use starter discord.js bot

## How do I set this up?
First, you will need to download the latest version of Node.JS, which can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After that, open up the command line and go to the file path where your bot would be (e.g. cd C:/Users/Eqilux/Desktop/Bot) and install discord.js (npm install discord.js)

Go to mybot.js (open it in a decent code editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text 3) and change ("SuperSecretBotToken") to your bot token, which can be found at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me, clicking your bot and click that reveal token link. Just be sure that you keep it private or people can control your bot...

Once you've set up everything, just say (node mybot.js) and your bot should be up and running! ðŸ˜‰

## Can I use this?
Of course you can! Improve on it, do anything you want. You don't have to credit me, but it'd be nice if you did. ðŸ™‚
